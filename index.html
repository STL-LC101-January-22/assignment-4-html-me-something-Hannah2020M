      <h1>Ocean Breeze</h1>
    <p> 
   
 In 2019 March, I went on a small term Christian
  mission trip with the members of my daughter's church.
Belize has an ocean and early in the morning, I'd go
  and play with the waves, while enjoying the <b>Belize breeze !</b>
  <br>


  I'd chase after the cool waves into the ocean and run backwards,
  when they tried to come back ashore ! <em><b>Waves of fun !!</b></em>
  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;
  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;
  It was a practice of being alert &nbsp!
  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;<br>

  My dad had never allowed me to become an introvert.
 "Being alert and attentive" to our surroundings and 
 all aspects of human society-is a major priority 
 in his lifestyle.I was trained in the history about
 how American Christian missionaries had changed my
 Indian society. His low caste dalith , Hindu ancestors
  had lived in a society, where the  caste laws have 
  legalized widow 
 burnings, Hindu temple slave dancers, child 
 marriages, illiteracy of girls etc. <em><b>In 1987 an 18 year
 old widow , named, Rupa Kunwar was burned to death in
 Rajasthan, a Northern state in India. </b></em> '94' years ago, 
 from this very state, the King of Kethri, had sent Swami 
 Vivekananda to USA, to speak in the  Parliament of 
 Religions  in Chicago on <b>9/11/</b>1893.
 
 After hearing about that tragic event, I made it one
 of my goals - to be a missionary one day and it
 came true, by God's grace in Belize in 2019. So I studied about
 missionaries of many religions.

         <p> <div id="Swami Vivekananda"></div>
         <p>Swami Vivekananda(Narendra),born in 1863,
             was a Hindu spiritual 
            leader,who took formal monastic vows in Antpur,India on the 
            <b>Christmas Eve of 1886.</b> In 1888, he left the monastery
            as a Hindu wandering monk.His sole possessions were 
            a water pot, staff and his two favourite books: 
         <br><em><b>the Bhagavad Gita</b></em> and <br><em><b>The Imitation of Christ.
            </b></em> <br>In Rajasthan, India,the King of 
             Kethri had given him the title of Vivekananda and had donated money
              in order to send him to USA, to speak in the Parliament of Religions
              on 1893<em><b> September 11. </b></em> 
             He was determined to spread Hindu vedantha education among 
             women and the lower caste 
            daliths and casteless Americans(White,Black and others).
            By 2022, USA has changed its life style, to embrace yoga stance, 
            instead of the traditional kneeling in Christian prayer.
            The investment on 9/11/1863 - made by the North Indian King 
            of Kethri has produced vast harvest and the daughter of 
            a <em><b>highest caste Brahmin lady,</b></em> is the Vice president of USA in 2022.
            Her achievement, is a great advancement for our entire Indian community !

             <p>Even though 
               the West had sent many White missionaries to India, no Caucasian
               was ever able to be the prime miniser of India - not even
               Sonia Gandhi, the Catholic wife of, our former prime minister 
               Rajiv Gandhi. I think, that might be because, Christian missionaries follow Jesus Christ,
               who came to seek and serve.
             "Christian" simply means, someone who follows 
            the Lord Jesus Christ and tries his best to
             imitate the lifestyle, "modelled by Lord Jesus".
            
             In a nut shell,having Christian values is to have a
                <br>"no hate",
                <br>"no-nonsense",
                <br> "self -sacrificing " ,
             <br> 
             
              healthiest lifestyle of joy, even when Iam not in happy circumstances.
              For example, doing my homework on a Friday night, is not an ideally
              happy situation.But I can be joyful because,<b> completing my homework </b>
              gets me closer to my healthier goal, than the temporary happiness of - 
              friday night partying !!</p>
         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
              Simply put,a Christian is a person who is consistently,
              <br><b>discipling </b> the unrepentant ones - lovingly, 
                  <br><b>forgiving </b>repentant ones - whole heartedly, and
                  <br><b>loving </b>the enemies courageously !
              <br>
            And I mean <em><b>"really,  "truly", loving the enemies</b></em> to the extent, that we do not think,"They are low 
            birth people; they are like animals and that's what they do. Let me just 
            get out of their way, or tolerate them for awhile, and wait for them to dance their way to destruction
            ... or <b>smoke</b> to their destruction or <b>over eat </b>to their early death."

              Christian type
             of life style does not alllow us to get very wealthy in tangible,
             physical assets.But its teasures are        
             healthier than the usual "dog -eat-dog" , rat race
             to the top of the corporate "power" ladder.
             This <em><b>'rat-race'</b></em> life style is like a bunch of
             fish pushing, pulling, mauling, manipulating, bruising and biting each other, in order to  swim up and get to
             the top, <em><b>while caught in a net !</b></em>
             <br style: "color = rgb(255, 255, 153);">Christian values are best depicted in a movie named, <em><b>"Finding Nemo"</b></em> !
            <br> Laugh if you must, but that's the simple truth !
           
         </p>

             <p> Christians know the truth, that we are all caught in the 
                net of imperfection or sin. So they swim down .The one who
                is at the lowest is the leader ... because we are uniting
                in the name of the "Truth"(Jesus ) , in order to break free of the net,
                through repentance and repairing the damage.<br>
                Lord Jesus stated in Matthew 20:26 :<br>
                
                <em><b>"..whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
                 and whoever wants to be first must be your slave— just as the 
                 Son of Man(Jesus) did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give 
                 his life as a ransom for many.”</b></em><br>
<br>
                I don't know, how well this will fly with Americans in 2022, but
                an American, named Adoniram Judson, who was born in the year,A.D. 1788 , had followed that healthiest Christian life style and
                is respected as the first Christian missionary.

               <b>Movies are the audio -visual aids to propagate the life style of vedantha and karma,</b> that trains people to
               believe, that even an imposter-claiming to be an idol of flesh(husband) or idol of god, needs to be offered worship.
               Even well-educated,  caste ladies who are lawyers, engineers, programmers are required by caste laws, to worship 
               the 'husband as god', during caste religious rituals, sitting in yoga-style pooja worship.<br> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;
               &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Just a reminder &nbsp &nbsp:<br>
               Our Eastern men are getting ready to make movies in English, in order to train, the less literate westerners, who aren't interested
              in reading captions, while watching a movie! Maybe they forgot, that British colonist king was defeated in AD 1776, by 
               courageous ones as these Americans.Manipulative movies couldn't  turn such courageous blood to water... evv..vverr !
       </p>

              <p>
               If I have skills to manipulate enough people, to believe, that, I am miss India, then US people might soon start 
               <b>tolerating,</b> my self-proclaimation of being an Indian idol ! Americans might deduce,logically, that, the rest of the
               Indian women are uglier than I look. After all, beauty is relative ,like performance in a beauty contest. 
               In AD 2000s, westerners are merely checking, the immigrants' scientific education skills in Math , tech and medicine and 
               are tripping over their toes to proclaim, that we are safe to rule over less-skilled Americans and make rules.Americans might
               be expediating the process of ushering immigrants into top positions in USA, in 
               order to facilitate westerners to focus on their diversions of flamboyant, vibrant activities. That is a dangerous
                <em><b>Trojan horse </b></em> mind set of <em><b>over confidence in Americans</b></em>
               that assumes: "immigrants to USA, would by default , leave the less healthier life style they were accustomed to in their 
               homelands." It is as dangerous as assuming, that, I'd leave the Indian life style of driving on the left side of road,
               as soon as I land in the good old US of A.Thankfully, I had to pass a test in US driving laws and practically 
               show an insrtuctor ,that Iam now ready to drive according to US driving laws. Graduating in Western education in
               the fields of Math, science etc .. does not automatically prepare me, to abandon my Indian driving style or overcome
               my vedantha , mystic KARMA. I might continue to  believe in a less healthier life style - of supporting dowry system 
               and  caste discrimination.  </p>

               For instance, on January 24,<b>2021</b>, an educated teacher sacrificed her daughters in pooja by murdering them. Vedantha education equips women to
               find a reason, to submit to caste laws and rituals, even after receiving logical education in the fields of Math, Physics
               etc. Scientific education with a foundation in Vedantha education is a <b>big</b> drop of the <b> poison of polygamy,</b> in 
               a pot of nourishing milk(Scientific education with a foundation of Christian life style). In 2022, in
               USA, many monogamous married Indian women with a firm foundation in Vedantha education, are quickly enabled
                to climb up the ladder of scientific skills, using fake resumes.As a result , USA that has been built
                in AD 1776, on the <em><b> forgivness foundation - that depends on repentance and repair </b></em> has 
                been brought to its yoga life style of believing in Karma - the residuous stuff of one's deeds from a previous birth,
                that is used as a reason to explain his current fortune or misfortune. Rituals are performed to make KARMA bearable.
                An educated Chemistry professor, who was a vice principal and his wife- who is a post graduate in mathematics , ritually 
                murdered their daughters in 2021, January 24 in Madanepalli, Andhra Pradesh, India. Scientific skills are no 
                measure to think, that, a woman or man is harmless.

               In the next year, 2023 our Indian community celebrates the 160th anniversary of the
               iconic speech, made by the Hindu missionary, Swami Vivekananda, who was sent by
               the  king of Kethri. In these 160 years, our Indian missionaries,who are mostly-<br>
               <b>strictly hetero-sexual , monogamous married moms,</b> have suceeded in replacing
                Christian prayer in US public schools with our Hindu worship 
               style of sitting in pooja stance of yoga.
               In the near future,  our Indian
               missionaries might succeed, in training US citizens to replace monarchs with oligarchs of Hollywood
               and tech empires !  Maybe our Hindu vedantha life style of being submissive
               under caste kings' monarchy would be facilitated in USA too . Time will tell .... but for now, let us read about how the
               Christian life style, of being <em><b>submissive to Jesus Christ alone</b></em>
               has helped Caucasian Christian missionaries, from the West- to rescue Indian women 
               from caste laws, enforced by caste kings, that had legalized <b>widow burning,</b>
                <b>temple slave girls,</b> <b>child marriages </b>and <b>illiteracy of women !</b>

         <p>Gladys Aylward was born in London in 1902.In October 
            of 1930, she set out from London with her passport,
            her Bible, her tickets, and two pounds ninepence, to 
            travel to China by the Trans-Siberian Railway, despite
            the fact that China and the Soviet Union were engaged 
            in an undeclared war. She arrived in Vladivostok and 
            sailed from there to Japan and from Japan to Tientsin, 
            and then by train, then bus, then mule, to the inland 
            city of Yangchen, in the mountainous province of Shansi, 
            a little south of Peking (Beijing). Most of the residents
             had seen no Europeans other than Mrs. Lawson and now Miss Aylward. They distrusted them as foreigners, and 
             were not disposed to listen to them.
                She adopted over a 100 Chinese children during the
            1938 Sino-Japanese war and bravely protected them.

         <p>American Dr. Kent Brantly moved to Monrovia, in Liberia in October
              of  2013, working for " Samaritan's Purse" as a medical 
             missionary.  In 2014, he treated patients and survived 
             after contracting ebola. His church family had nurtured his faith 
             from the time he was very young. Prior to his departure to 
             Liberia, he told them, "Every one of you who knew me -  when 
            I was a little boy, or who saw me grow as a teenager, or who 
            offered me friendship as a college student or graduate student, 
            <b>every one of you has touched my life and shaped who I am today."
            </b> Brantly has met privately with the President of the United 
              States - President Barack Obama in 2014.He  donated his
              plasma, thrice, to aid the recovery of other ebola patients.
              In an interview with "National Public Radio", he shared, 
              "When we can get to that point where we feel the same sense 
              of empathy and compassion for people who are suffering, even 
              though we don't know them; I think that's what Jesus is talking
               about when He says 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"

              <br> The American Dr. Kent Brantley told Time, "I chose a career in medicine because I wanted 
               a tangible skill with which to <em><b>serve</b></em> people, and so my role 
               as a physician is my attempt to do that." In 2019 he went back to serve in Liberia.

        <h1> FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE </h1>
    </header>

      

        

<p>
        I came back to USA,after  a week in  Belize, in 2019 
        and was asked to speak at a
        church congregation dinner prayer.
         I shared about what touched me the most !! 
        A Belize woman, was given the gift of a home visit by
        our medical team .The doctor checked her family members'
         vitals and eye sight, and  gave prescriptions. Then he asked, if 
         anyone had anything else that needs medical attention.
        After making sure ,that, no one else needed any medical
        attention, this woman requested the doctor to help
        her ,take care of a wound on her leg ,and unwrapped the bandage.
        To everyone's horror, her wound was a mess that required
        urgent medical attention ! We were dumb struck !
</p>
<h1>OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND </h1>
   
   <p>
        The woman's leg wound  was something their local doctors
         could not handle. So they had
        covered it up and hoped it would be <em><b>"out of sight and out of mind ",</b></em>... sort of like US illegal immigration horrors.
        Maybe it was <em> <b> out of sight for them, but not for the 
           suffering lady </b></em> who has to bear the emotional pain of being set aside,
        on top of her physical pain every minute  of her
        day !! It's easy for others, to be in denial when she cries out in
        pain and use her pain to legalize drug Lord's marijuana business.
        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Same scenario with bitterness.
        <br>Just because we put our bitterness out of sight of others
         it does not go out of our minds. It is better to nip the 
         bitterness in the bud at the starting stage by
         communicating in a decent way about issues like male chavunism, caste discrimination,
         lack of women's rights etc..          
          
         
      </p>

      <div id= "Neck trick"></div>
         <h1>NECK TRICK </h1>
         <p>
           My dad used to quote a highest caste prime minister,
           Mrs Indira Gandhi about <b>neck trick</b>.I remember that !
            instead of being bitter about, having to be submissive, to the head - the powerful US (men& women's) agenda,
            that makes powerless women bleed in body and womb, I tell myself ,"Iam like the neck, under the head !" 
            <b>When you make a woman bleed in the womb, it hurts .... bad !</b>
             Such intense pain imprints in the woman's very soul ! 
            When I remember that pain, I stand in front of 
            Planned Parenthood and request Americans ,<b> not to make woman's wombs bleed ! </b>
            <b>The powerful ones and the powerless ones are interdependant too !</b>
            The powerful women and men,(the heads) do not have what I cherish <b>more often than they do </b> :
            The neck gets to wear the priceless pretty, necklace more often :<br><em><b>my kids loving hands when she hugs!!</b></em> 
           <br> <br>
            <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/97089b6b-7328-4599-bd5d-84eb986b5ee5/1dMostPreciousNecklace.png" alt="MyNeckIsRewardedWithMyKidsLovingHandsAroundMyNeck" style="width:1200px;height:600px;">
            <br><br> It is healthier for the neck, to push a head up than to pull a head up.
            So the neck stays submissively , under the head to 
            push it up. They are interdependent - just as ...  <br><b> men and women are interdependent !</b><br>
            The rich and poor are interdependent too.<br> Political parties are interdependent too !<br>
            Please , let us <b>not allow the enemy </b> of this democratic republic <b>divide and rule over USA !</b>
            The head is in pain, when the neck cannot perform its function.
            I hurt my neck in a car accident in July of 2020.<br>
            Boy ! did my head suffer ! <br>My head couldn't even rest on a 
            pillow properly.<br>Finally, I learnt to fold the pillow to
            rest my poor little head !<br><br>
            <a class="tab1"><img src="https://ucarecdn.com/4dde2cd5-d28d-4c71-8ddf-e025ed869ce6/2013MtCalAngelasCOnfirmationKeepImpVVVVgHannahAa.jpg" alt="MyNeckIsRewardedWithMyKidsLovingHandsAroundMyNeck" style="width:1200px;height:600px;">
            </a>
            <br><br>Never ignore the neck in the body....<br>
                   .....or the speck in the eye.<br>
                   In 1860s, in USA, a few Blacks <b> had used the right to choose, to enable slavery, </b> by fighting on the side of the 
                   confederate army. That was not a healthy, Black person's right - it is the harmful plank in the eyes of the 
                   Caucasian slave owners, who manipulated the Black person's mind. Manipulating women to choose abortion, is just as illogical,
                   dangerous, and inhumane. Legalized abortion was merely started 50 years ago, as a cruel privilege of immigrant millioniares to contorl the population of healthier American citizens.
                   I pray that, the westerners would not be manipulated, to enable caste supremacy discrimination, for the perks of free internet
                    sites and enslaved caste ladies who are bring brought to the west, to provide submissive, sweet slave service.
                  
                   
                   <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Meanwhile, on a lighter note, it is hilarious to watch China pose as an opposer 
                      of Russia in 2022. I am sure, that my American daughter would not have to flee as a refugee to China, when Russian gangsters
                      war with US . Both China and Russia,could make a pact - "You chase Americans out and I pretend to be their rescue hero and 
                      take Americans in, as refugees and later enslave them."
                     <b>Hilarious </b>to think, that US would fall for such pretentions of China. China would probably want to enslave rich US women as refugees 
                      and make poor US women their slave drivers .
                   
                   <img style="height:35px; width:80px;"src ="https://ucarecdn.com/b22b86f9-f04d-47ab-811d-d7ebca32369d/eyeRoll.jpg" alt ="eyeroll">
                  
                    <em><b>Powerful women in USA are the ones, who came up with those - </b></em><b>enslaving illegal immigrantion tricks</b> 
                     of bribing the 
                    powerful ones in the Eastern countries,
                    to persecute their poor, so that,  their well-educated ones could be brought in to USA, as refugees and supply cheap labor and 
                    "ME TOO" victims, whose evidence of victimization, could then be wiped out  ,by using abortion. </b>My friend in India was battered 
                    by her alcoholic husband, until her 
                    well-educated son used a fake bank account set up by a trillionaire ruler and managed to come to study in Kansas,USA , in 2021.
                    The sooner US removes the plank of <b> legalized abortion</b>, in its own eye, the sooner US could remove the speck in the 
                    Russia's eye and cruel communist dictator's eye
                     and India's trillionaire caste king's eye
                     .... so that, women like myself and my friend would not continue to bear bruises, bleeding and bullying.
                   Doctors in 2000 AD have already banned the medieval practice of blood-letting, and so I have hope that
                  US powerful men and women would soon 
                   find Christian resources, to remove the plank in their eye the right to abortion and gain resources to remove the speck in caste 
                   supremacist's eye !
                   </p> 
                   <p>
                   <em><b>Progress without protection for powerless</b></em> women and children ( basic building blocks of future human race) is
                    dangerous.
                   It is like ignoring to protect the <em><b>foundation, of women's rights,</b></em>
           in order to attract,  <em><b>attention </b></em> by spending more on the building.<br>
           Let us not ruin our strong, <em><b>good foundation</b></em> to gain needless fame or <em><b>attention !</b></em><br>
           I fervently hope that each of us, would avoid the fake <em><b>"glitter grease </b></em> and make use of the bessing of my <em><b>"Belize breeze" !</b></em>
           The  sole purpose of women's rights is :
           <em><b> 'the  common good of all'&nbsp !</b></em> <br><br> Isn't it horrifying, that, medical doctors, actually used leeches, in the
            medieval ages, to bleed 
           patients, just as US powerful women are using aborion to bleed powerless women out of babies in 2022?!!
